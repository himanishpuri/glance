**Glance is a free, open-source alternative to Apple's macOS Preview app for Windows 10 and 11.** It opens PDFs, images (including HEIC and camera RAW), 3D models, and Word, PowerPoint and Excel files in one small app, and brings Preview's everyday superpowers to Windows: rearranging and merging PDF pages by dragging, dragging pages out to create new files, real redaction, markup and signatures, background removal, metadata scrubbing, batch processing, and more. It's built to feel native on Windows 11 (Fluent design, Mica, Explorer integration) while staying small and fast. The same app also [runs in any browser](https://redtrocks.github.io/glance/app/), on phones too, and AI apps such as Claude and Codex can [use it as a tool](docs/AI-APPS.md).

> **Status: early preview.** Viewing, PDF page management, markup, signatures, forms, redaction, OCR, image editing, batch editing and metadata tools work today. Everything else is on the roadmap below and in [`docs/adr`](docs/adr).

## Why it's light

- **Tauri 2 + WebView2**: the UI runs in the Edge engine already built into Windows 10/11, so Glance doesn't ship its own browser. The installer is under 20 MB (about 18 MB for x64).
- **Rust backend**: file access and image decoding run natively. Windows' own codecs come first ([WIC](docs/adr/0010-native-first-decoding.md)), so camera RAW and HEIC work whenever Windows supports them.
- **Lazy engines**: the startup bundle is ~35 KB gzipped. PDF.js loads only when you open a PDF, pdf-lib only when you first edit one, and the 3D engine only for models.

| Web version at [redtrocks.github.io/glance/app](https://redtrocks.github.io/glance/app/): the same app in any modern browser, installable, works offline, files never leave the device ([what it can't do](#faq)) | ✅ |
| Ask AI sidebar: chat with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Qwen, Kimi, Mistral or OpenCode about the open file (whole page or a selected area), signed in with your own account or an API key, or use the company's website in the sidebar; chats are kept per document | ✅ |
| Windows 11 top-level context menu (needs a signed build) | Milestone 6 |

Signing on an iPhone or iPad (Preview's Continuity feature) isn't possible on Windows; use the camera or a photo of your signature instead.

Glance deliberately has no quick-look popup: pair it with [PowerToys Peek](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/powertoys/peek) (Ctrl+Space in Explorer) and press Enter to continue in Glance ([ADR 0011](docs/adr/0011-no-quick-look-pair-with-peek.md)).

## Privacy

No accounts. Glance sends two optional things, both off with a switch in Settings: a daily check for a newer release on GitHub (the Microsoft Store version leaves updates to the Store), and an anonymous daily count of installs that adds up to how many copies are in use (version number only, no ID and nothing you open). Background removal and text recognition run on your PC. AI apps you connect in Settings → AI apps send what they read through Glance to their own AI provider, and Ask AI sends what you share in the sidebar to the AI company you pick there.

## FAQ

**Is there a macOS Preview app for Windows?**
Apple doesn't make one. Glance is a free, open-source app that does the same jobs on Windows 10 and 11: viewing PDFs and images, rearranging and merging PDF pages, markup, signatures, redaction, Instant Alpha and Adjust Color.

**Is Glance free?**
Yes. It's free and open source under the Apache-2.0 license, with no ads, account or paid tier. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/RedtRocks/glance/releases/latest).

**Can Glance edit PDFs?**
It can reorder, rotate, delete, split and merge pages, fill forms, add text, shapes, highlights, notes and signatures, sign with a certificate, and permanently redact text. It doesn't rewrite a PDF's existing body text like a word processor.

**Does Glance send my files anywhere?**
No. There's no account and nothing you open leaves your PC. Text recognition and background removal run on your PC. Besides an optional update check, Glance sends one anonymous daily count of installs (version number only), which you can turn off in Settings. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

**What file types does it open?**
PDF, XPS, EPS and AI files, JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, HEIC, JPEG XL, TIFF, PSD, OpenEXR, SVG, camera RAW, comic book archives, 3D models such as GLB, OBJ, STL and USDZ, Word, PowerPoint and Excel files, CSV, Markdown, text and code, EPUB, email, fonts, video and audio. The full list is in [docs/FORMATS.md](docs/FORMATS.md).

**Can I use Glance on a phone, a Mac or a Chromebook?**
Yes, in the browser: open [redtrocks.github.io/glance/app](https://redtrocks.github.io/glance/app/) and install it from the browser menu if you like. It works offline and your files stay on the device. A few things need the Windows app: text recognition, scanning, Explorer integration, the Windows share sheet, certificate signatures, PostScript and XPS files, and autosave (in the browser, saving downloads the file).

**Can I ask an AI about a document I have open?**
Yes, in the Windows app. Press **Ask AI** to chat with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini and others in a sidebar about the page you're on or an area you select. Sign in with your own account or paste an API key. What you share goes to the AI company you picked.

**Can AI apps like Claude or Codex use Glance?**
Yes. Connect them in **Settings → AI apps** and they can view, read, convert, combine, split and redact your files through Glance, and see the page you have open. See [docs/AI-APPS.md](docs/AI-APPS.md).

## Building from source

Requirements: Node.js 22+, Rust (stable), and on Windows the WebView2 runtime (preinstalled on Windows 10/11).

```sh
npm install
npm run tauri dev        # run with hot reload
npm run tauri build      # produce the NSIS installer in src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis
npm test                 # frontend unit tests
cd src-tauri && cargo test   # decoder tests (WIC tests run on Windows)
```

Every pull request builds a Windows installer in CI (see the `glance-windows-x64-installer` artifact).

## Linux

Glance also builds for Fedora 42+ (x86_64 and aarch64). Download `Glance-<tag>-linux-x86_64.rpm` (or `-aarch64.rpm`) from the [latest release](https://github.com/RedtRocks/glance/releases/latest) and install it:

```sh
sudo dnf install ./Glance-<tag>-linux-x86_64.rpm
```

It installs `glance` and `glance-mcp` in `/usr/bin` and registers Glance for its file types. Install `ghostscript` (recommended by the package) for PostScript and EPS. To build from source, install the Tauri prerequisites (`sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ clang webkit2gtk4.1-devel openssl-devel librsvg2-devel libxdo-devel nodejs npm`), then run `npm install && npx tauri build --bundles rpm`; the RPM lands in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/rpm`.

Not on Linux yet: Text Recognition, scanning, Certificate Signatures, Open With and default apps from inside Glance, Set as Wallpaper, the share sheet, speech input, XPS and JPEG XR. Saved signatures and AI API keys are stored in your login keyring (Secret Service, such as GNOME Keyring or KWallet).

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please read [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) for the project's vocabulary and [`docs/adr`](docs/adr) for the decisions behind the design.

**Translations.** Write every piece of UI text through `t()` from `src/i18n` (see the comment at the top of `src/i18n/index.ts`), in English, with placeholders instead of string concatenation: `t('Exported {file}', { file })`, `t('{count, plural, one {# page} other {# pages}}', { count })`. Text defined outside components, such as command labels, is marked with `msg()` and passed through `t()` where it's shown. `npm test` fails on UI text that skips `t()`, and `npm run i18n` lists it. To add or update a language, run `npm run i18n -- <code>` (for example `de` or `pt-BR`) and fill in `src/i18n/locales/<code>.json`. To check layout with longer text, pick the pseudo-locale in Settings → Language (shown in dev builds).

## License

[Apache-2.0](LICENSE). Glance never bundles GPL/AGPL components. Ghostscript, used for PostScript, is run as a separate program only if you install it.
